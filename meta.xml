		<short_description>Trojan LCD Simulator for Wii</short_description>
		<long_description>Here is the Trojan LCD game simulator I wrote. I have it running on PC, OSX, NDS, Wii and the original xbox. I decided to write it using SDL so It would port easliy. OS X was the easiest while the PC and Visual Studio was a big pain in the butt. I didn’t simulate the date or time functions as I was only interested in the game play element. Have Fun.</long_description>
